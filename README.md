The current election result tracking system in South Africa, managed by the IEC (Independent Electoral Commission), 
relies on a manual process where information is written by hand. This method is prone to mistakes, delays, and potential corruption,
leading to frustration among the public as they wait for results. The manual nature of the system, from voter eligibility verification to 
data recording and final result announcement, is error-prone and time-consuming.

VOTEGUARD aims to modernize this process by automating the collection and verification of voting data.
It will gather critical details such as vote counts, signatures, names, and pictures, 
then use image processing to extract the information from photos taken at voting stations
Once a super admin confirms the accuracy, results are calculated and displayed immediately, 
allowing users to see results before the official IEC announcement. This automation enhances accuracy,
reduces errors, prevents manipulation, and speeds up result announcements, improving public trust in the system. Additionally,
VOTEGUARD offers real-time data access, automated eligibility verification, and robust security to protect data integrity and ensure transparency.
